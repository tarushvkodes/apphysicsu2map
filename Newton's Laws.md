# Newton's Laws

## First Law (Inertia)
- "Sum of forces = 0 → velocity is constant"
- Inertial frames
  - Non-accelerating frames
  - Newton’s laws only valid here
- Non-inertial frames
  - Require fictitious forces
    - Centrifugal force
    - Coriolis force
    - Euler force
- Mass as inertia
  - More mass → more resistance to acceleration
  - Inertial vs gravitational mass
- Examples
  - Object sliding on frictionless ice
  - Spacecraft drifting in deep space
  - Tablecloth trick (high inertia of dishes)

## Second Law (Dynamics)
- "Sum of forces = dp/dt = m a"
- Vector relationship
  - Consider x, y, z components separately
- Variable mass systems
  - Rockets
  - Leaking carts
- Forces and free-body diagrams
  - Identify system
  - Draw only external forces
  - Break into components

### Common Forces
- Gravity  
  - mg  
  - Universal gravitation: G m1 m2 / r^2  
  - Weight vs mass
- Normal force (N)
  - Perpendicular to surface
  - On incline: N = mg cosθ
- Friction  
  - Static friction: μs N  
  - Kinetic friction: μk N
  - Rolling friction
  - Friction on inclines
- Tension
  - Ideal rope assumptions
  - Different tensions with massive ropes
- Spring force  
  - -k x
  - Spring energy (½ k x²)
  - Series and parallel springs
- Drag forces  
  - -b v (low speed)
  - -c v² (high speed)
  - Terminal velocity
- Applied forces  
  - Push/pull forces
  - Force at an angle

### Motion Types
- Linear motion
  - Constant acceleration
  - Variable acceleration
- Circular motion
  - Centripetal force: m v² / r
  - Banked curves
  - Vertical loops
- Multi-object systems
  - Atwood machines
  - Blocks connected by ropes
  - Multi-pulley systems
- Pulleys and constraints
  - Acceleration relationships
  - Mechanical advantage
- Motion with drag
  - Exponential approach to terminal velocity
  - Quadratic drag differential equations
- Inclined planes
  - Components of gravity
  - Static vs kinetic friction

## Third Law (Action-Reaction)
- "Force from A on B = - Force from B on A"
- Forces act on different objects
- Third-law pairs do NOT cancel in an FBD
- Interaction pairs
  - Hands pushing together
  - Earth–moon gravitational forces
  - Rocket thrust and expelled gases
- Internal vs external forces
  - Only external forces accelerate a system
- Examples
  - Book pushing on table ↔ table pushing on book
  - Person walking (action on ground ↔ reaction from ground)
  - Recoil from firing projectile
